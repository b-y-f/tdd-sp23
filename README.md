Almost all of the pattern tests have been successful. However, there is a minor issue in that the method used to cut new lines is unclear. The website specifies that each line should not [exceed 70 words](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded#:~:text=Lines%20in%20the%20RLE%20file%20must%20not%20exceed%2070%20characters), so a simple cut by length was employed. This solution is inadequate in cases where there is a large pattern. Writing the pattern to a file was deemed unnecessary.
